Migration Strategy
Phase 1: Set up FastAPI backend with basic endpoints

Phase 2: Implement WebSocket for real-time communication

Phase 3: Migrate video processing to async tasks

Phase 4: Add database persistence

Phase 5: Integrate with your existing frontend

The FastAPI + WebSockets + PostgreSQL combination would be my top recommendation 
for your radiotherapy application, providing the real-time capabilities, scalability, 
and reliability required for medical applications while maintaining compatibility with 
your existing frontend
